## 91. Factory fucntion
```javascript
function createElf(name, weapon) {
  //we can also have closures here to hide properties from being changed.
  return {
    name: name,
    weapon: weapon,
    atack() {
      return 'atack with ' + weapon
    }
  }
}
const sam = createElf('Sam', 'bow');
const peter = createElf('Peter', 'bow');

sam.atack()
```

- Problems: function attack() bị copy cho từng Elf

## 92. Object.create()
```javascript
const elfFunctions = {
  attack: function() {
    return 'atack with ' + this.weapon
  }
}
function createElf(name, weapon) {
  //Object.create creates __proto__ link
  newElf = Object.create(elfFunctions)
  newElf.name = name;
  newElf.weapon = weapon
  return newElf
}


const sam = createElf('Sam', 'bow');
const peter = createElf('Peter', 'bow');
sam.attack()
```

## 93. Constructor function
```javascript
//Constructor Functions
function Elf(name, weapon) {
  this.name = name;
  this.weapon = weapon;
}

Elf.prototype.attack = function() { 
  return 'atack with ' + this.weapon
}
const sam = new Elf('Sam', 'bow');
const peter = new Elf('Peter', 'bow');
sam.attack()
```

- the "this" variable points a new empty object, and the object is returned from the function atomatically
- only way we an add properties is to use this keyword

## 95. If primitives have no properties, why does "abc".length return a value?

- Because JavaScript will readily coerce between primitives and objects. In this case the string value is coerced to a string object in order to access the property length

## 96. ES6 class
```javascript
class Elf {
  constructor(name, weapon) {
    this.name = name;
    this.weapon = weapon;
  }
  attack() {
    return 'atack with ' + this.weapon
  }
}

const fiona = new Elf('Fiona', 'ninja stars');
console.log(fiona instanceof Elf) // 
const ben = new Elf('Ben', 'bow');
fiona.attack()
```

## 98. This 4 way
```javascript
// new binding
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age =age;
  console.log(this);
}

const person1 = new Person('Xavier', 55)

//implicit binding
const person = {
  name: 'Karen',
  age: 40,
  hi() {
    console.log('hi' + this.name)
  }
}

person.hi()

//explicit binding
const person3 = {
  name: 'Karen',
  age: 40,
  hi: function() {
    console.log('hi' + this.setTimeout)
  }.bind(window)
}

person3.hi()

// arrow functions
const person4 = {
  name: 'Karen',
  age: 40,
  hi: function() {
    var inner = () => {
      console.log('hi ' + this.name)
    }
    return inner()
  }
}

person4.hi()
```

## 103. 4 pillars of oop
1. Encapsulation
- We wrap code into boxes that are related to one another so that these boxes can just interact with each other using the methods and properties that we make available. This makes code easier to maintain and more reusable right. We have all these nice little class packages that we can just use whenever we want.

2. Abstraction

- Abstraction means just hiding the complexity from the user that is creating simpler interfaces such as Hey I'll take care of the class all you do is instantiate a class and there you go poof.

- You have an elf with all the properties and methods already and for you and the idea of abstraction says hey here are the methods and properties that you can use.
Don't worry about everything else. I'll do all the calculations behind the scenes.

3. Inheritance
- We avoid having to rewrite the same code and we also save memory space by having shared methods.

4. Polymorphism

There's many interpretation of what it means but the idea is the ability to call the same method on different objects and each object responding in different way.
